					Without a team, the entire project falls on your shoulders and nobody wants that. 
					Would spider-geddon have been stopped without the help of multiverse spider-men? I don’t think so!
					Having a team will allow the work to be divided equally and each member can 
					focus on specific aspects of the game such as Music, Art, etc.</p>

					<p>Before getting into the deep details of a game, you want your

					You want your company's name to be something memorable. Something unique. 
					There can only be so many "Dark Horse Studios" in the world. On top of creating your name you'll also want to create a logo.
					The logo can be something that represents either your company name or your game. If you plan to make more than one game,
					your logo should reflect your name as opposed to your game. If you only have one game/series then the choice is all yours!
					Now that you have a name and logo, it’s time to stake your claim!</p>

					The more detailed you are during your envision stage, the more prepared you are for the creation stages.

						Concept art is extremely important because it allows the team to decide which concepts they like, 
						those that can be improved upon, and those that can be set aside.
						Without concept art, a lot of time would be spent creating assets for designs that may not even end up being used in the final cut.

					<p>Art isn’t the only thing that develops the tone of a game. 
					Music is a huge component that can really make or break a game’s style. Have your Music director begin to create music concepts. 
					They don’t have to be long, maybe 30 seconds at most. Having those clips allows the music director and 
					the rest of the team to pick and choose which pieces they like best. Having music samples that are chosen by the team
					allows the music director to develop the musical style of the game. Having an established musical style will ensure
					that the each of the games musical compositions don't deviate too much tonally.</p>

					Selecting Your Engine
				</div>
				<div class = "rows engineDescription">
					<p>Now that the other fields are on their way, it’s time to start actually developing the game. 
					It is time to get coding.
					BUT before you begin the coding process, you have to decide which engine you would like to use to get your game going. 
					A game engine acts as both, your development environment as well as the game environment. 
					Inside of the engine is where you will be placing all of your assets for scenes, implementing code and creating animations.
					The game engine is essentially one of your biggest assets that you need to fully embrace in order to create a great game.
					Deciding on which engine to build your game on can be tricky.
					There are a plethora of different engines you can use that are already prebuilt, working, and come highly regarded.
					You need to find an engine that suits your needs better than the others.
					For example, if you are creating a 2-Dimensional game with hand-drawn sprites, you should consider using the Unity engine above the 
					far more powerful Unreal Engine 4.
					The reason for choosing Unity over Unreal Engine 4, despite Unreal being more powerful, is that Unity is designed with 2D 
					development support already built in. The engine provides many useful tools for 
					2D game development, including bounding boxes and object physics, that won't be present in Unreal Engine 4 as Unreal is mostly used to develop 3-Dimensional games.
					It’s entirely up to you. If you can't seem to find an engine that suits your needs, many developers create their own. This way it is suited to their exact
					specifications without all of the excess that comes with prebuilt engines.</p>

					<p>Now that you’ve picked your engine, it’s time to actually begin coding your game. 
						Start by working on basic gameplay mechanics and work your way up from there. 
						Work on each gameplay component as its own project and don’t try to do too much at once. 
						Small steps is key.
						By taking different pieces of gameplay and isolating them, you can make ensure that each piece is working exactly as intended.
						This way, if there are errors, you know that there are pieces of different mechanics that conflict and you can isolate the problem easier.
						This also ensures that your gameplay elements don't get tangled up in each other.
						If different gameplay pieces become entwined then it will prove to be more difficult to debug.</p>

					<p>Now that you’ve gotten everything moving, your game is ready to go into beta. 
					Playtesting is key in order to get enough feedback to make your game good. 
					The point of playtesting is to have various people test out your game and provide you with detailed
					criticisms. The key to a good playtesting session is to have as many people play it as possible.
					The more people to playtest, the more opinions you get and thus the more data you have to work with.
					After each playtesting sesstion, talk over the data with your team and make assessments.
					Decide what needs to be fixed and begin working ONLY once all playtesters have finished.
					Once you make your changes create another round of playtesting until you reach the amount of player satisfaction you are looking for.</p>

					Finalize Your Product
				</div>
				<div class = "rows finalizeDescription">
					<p>You’ve gotten your feedback. You've finished your assets. Your game went into beta. Now it’s time to get ready to push to market. 
					Tidy up any loose ends, bugs, etc. because it's time to make that sucker public.
					Once you finalize your game, your final step is to upload your game for others to enjoy.
					The final decision is now upon you. Where to upload your game in order for players to get there hands on it.
					There are many different platforms to upload your game to and unlike with choosing engines, there's not really a downside to any of them.
					In fact, it wouldn't hurt to upload your game to multiple platforms.
					Many independent game developers upload their games to major vendors such as Steam as well as platforms specifically 
					designed for independent developers such as GameJolt.
					If you added controller support and console optimization, you could even work to get it on the XBOX Live or Playstation Network marketplaces.
					Just make sure you are aware that in order to upload your game to certain platforms it will cost you some money. 
					Steam allows anybody to upload their games but have a fee of $100 to upload your game. Others, like the XBOX Live Indie Marketplace
					have subscription services that allow you to upload as many games as you want, so long as you are a member.
					Ultimately, the choice is yours where to upload your game. All that's left is to watch your game's analytics and pray for proper exposure.
					Good Luck!</p>
