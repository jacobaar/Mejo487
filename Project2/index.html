					<p>The first step in the process is getting your team together. 
					Without a team, the entire project falls on your shoulders and nobody wants that. 
					Would the world have been saved without the Avengers? I don’t think so. 
					Having a team will allow the work to be divided equally and each member can 
					focus on specific aspects of the game such as Music, Art, etc.</p>

					Art isn’t the only thing that develops the tone of a game. 
					Music is a huge component that can really make or break a game’s style. Have your Music director begin to create music concepts. 
					They don’t have to be long, maybe 30 seconds tops. Having those clips allows the music director and 
					the rest of the team to pick and choose which pieces they like best.

						Small steps is key.
